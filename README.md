# IPL Score Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting IPL cricket match scores based on various factors. The project uses machine learning techniques to predict the scores and is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook.


## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL_Score_Prediction.git
    cd IPL_Score_Prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Add your dataset to the `data` folder. Ensure it is named `IPL_data.csv` or update the notebook accordingly.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook notebooks/IPL_Score_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Project Description

The project aims to predict the score of an IPL match using machine learning. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and score prediction. Dropdown menus and buttons are used for user interaction.
